# hello_world

My name is Pouncequick. Anyone who gets the reference wins brownie points from me. I am a recent graduate of aerospace engineering looking to get into graduate school and pursue computational fluid dynamics for a doctorate because I'm probably insane. I like tea, cats, reading and Pokemon when I'm not buried under all the information I'm reading. I've gotten this to go through the Aerostudents and 12 Steps to Navier Stokes online classes helpfully posted by Dr. Barba but I think I'll keep posting any new codes I make during this journey as well. I'm not sure this will help many people, but if anyone who stumbles across it and learns something from my efforts would make me quite happy.
